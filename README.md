Important Note 1: I have added db_credentials.txt in the .gitignore file so it's not showing but it's very important to start the project because it contains 
URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/book_store
USERNAME:<your_db_username>
PASSWORD:<your_db_password>

Important Note 2: because the url contains '/book_store' already so make the schema first in your MySql Workbench then only it will work.
